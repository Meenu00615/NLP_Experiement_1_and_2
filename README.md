# Transformer Models in Deep Learning: A Review

## Abstract
Transformer models have emerged as a pivotal advancement in deep learning, revolutionizing various fields, particularly natural language processing (NLP). Originating from the seminal paper "Attention is All You Need," these models have swiftly become ubiquitous in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. This review paper comprehensively explores the architecture, innovations, functionality, and applications of transformer models, elucidating their transformative impact on diverse domains.

## Introduction
Provides a brief overview of transformer models' significance in modern AI and machine learning landscapes. Discusses the inception of transformer models, key contributors, and their rapid adoption across multiple domains.

## Architecture and Innovations
Delves into the architecture of transformer models, elucidating the two fundamental innovations: positional encoding and self-attention mechanism. Explores how these innovations enable transformers to process input sequences efficiently and capture intricate relationships within the data.

## Input Embeddings
-	The process begins with the transformation of input data, which could be sequences of tokens (such as words or subword pieces) or other structured data, into numerical representations called embeddings.
-	These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the tokens in the input sequence. For sequences of words, embeddings can be learned during training or obtained from pre-trained word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.
â€¢	The input embeddings serve as the initial representations of the input data and are fed into the transformer model for further processing.


## Positional Encoding
Incorporates positional encoding to provide information about the position of each token in the input sequence. Introduction of additional values or vectors encoding position information. Addition of positional encodings to token embeddings before feeding them into the transformer model.

## Multi-Head Attention
Core component enabling capture of relationships between different tokens in the input sequence. Transformation of input embeddings through multiple attention heads. Calculation of attention weights using softmax functions to determine token importance.

## Layer Normalization and Residual Connections
Utilization of layer normalization and residual connections to stabilize and speed up training. Ensuring consistent distribution of values within each layer. Retention of information from previous layers to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.

## Feedforward Neural Networks
Passage of output through feedforward neural networks for non-linear transformations. Application of element-wise operations, activation functions (commonly ReLU), and linear transformations.

## Stacked Layers
Inclusion of multiple layers stacked on top of each other. Gradual refinement of input data representations through each layer. Capture of hierarchical and abstract features in the data.

## Output Layer
Addition of a separate decoder module in sequence-to-sequence tasks like neural machine translation. Production of final predictions or representations for the given task.

## Training and Inference
Training via supervised learning to minimize loss function. Utilization of optimization techniques like Adam or stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Inference through passing input sequences through pre-trained models for prediction or representation generation.

## Functionality
Step-by-step breakdown of transformer model operation, from input embeddings to stacked layers. Insights into inner workings of transformer models.

## Applications
